# C++ Rewrite

It would be neat to rewrite this repository in C++. It would make a lot of stuff easier and shrink code size while not really affecting performance. C++ is meant to be a better C, so why not use it? Well currently there's not much that can't be done easily in C, so I am holding off on C++ conversion for now.
