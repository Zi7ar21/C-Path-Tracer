# C Path-Tracer

This repository contains a Single-Threaded Path-Tracer written in C. It runs on the CPU and saves the render to a Targa Image file on the disk. There is plans to make it Multithreaded and to use a different image format that supports better color-depth. PPM (Portable PixMap) was a canidate but GIMP doesn't support 16-Bit Binary PPM.
