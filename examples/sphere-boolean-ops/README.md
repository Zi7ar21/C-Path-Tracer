# C Path-Tracer

This repository contains a Single-Threaded [Path-Tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing) written in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). It runs on the CPU and saves the render as a [Truevision TGA (Targa) Image (`*.tga`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA) Image file on the disk. There is plans to make it Multithreaded and to use a different image format that supports better [color-depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth). [Portable PixMap (`*.ppm`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) was a canidate but [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) doesn't support 16-Bit Binary PPM.
